# Cocktail Finder üçπ

> This project is built with vanilla JavaScript, the CocktailDb API and Bootstrap.

### How it was built ‚öôÔ∏è

1. I used the basic principles of [object-oriented programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) in JavaScript to build a component-based structure for the data. The main components are created and updated dynamically based on the responses from the CocktailDB API.

2. The [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) provides the data for all the cocktails' images, ingredients and other details. It's a free open crowd-sourced database of drinks and cocktails from around the world.

3. [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used for the various UI elements such as the navigation, menus, buttons and modals. It's a free, open source CSS Framework for developing responsive websites.

4. How to run this front-end app in CodeSpaces
